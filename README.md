# Simple Distributed Key-Value Store

## Project Overview
This project implements a basic distributed key-value store with a REST API, data partitioning, and a command-line interface for visualization.

## Features
- Basic key-value operations (Get, Put, Delete)
- REST API using Spring Boot
- Data partitioning across multiple nodes
- Basic consistency mechanism
- Command-line interface for system interaction
- Visualization of partitions and data distribution (Rust CLI)

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Java with Spring Boot
- CLI Visualization: Rust
- Build Tool: Maven (Java), Cargo (Rust)
- API Testing: Postman or curl
